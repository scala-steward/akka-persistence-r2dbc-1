 * The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) approach captures short-term movements in volatility for a
 * conditional volatility forecasting model. By virtue of its alpha, or decay factor, this provides a statistical
 * streaming data model that is exponentially biased towards newer entries.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average
 *
 * An EWMA only needs the most recent forecast value to be kept, as opposed to a standard moving average model.

 *   decay factor, sets how quickly the exponential weighting decays for past data compared to new data, see
